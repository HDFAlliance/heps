# A Manifesto for the Future of HDF

The HDF project has quietly enabled breakthroughs across science, engineering, and industry for over two decades. From NASA missions to climate modeling, from synchrotron science to advanced manufacturing, HDF technologies—HDF4, HDF5, HDFView—have helped users manage, share, and make sense of complex data.

This success is no accident. HDF's open, public-domain status has enabled users to read and write HDF data on nearly every computing platform, in almost any programming language, and across various disciplines. It has encouraged experimentation, creativity, and feedback. Bug fixes, feature requests, contributed tools, and novel use cases from thousands of users have shaped HDF into the robust, versatile data foundation it is today.

But today, HDF stands at a crossroads.

## HDF Has Grown—But Without a Common Plan

Despite its impact and widespread use, the HDF project has never had a formal governance structure. Its success has been powered by the commitment of a few organizations and individuals, primarily The HDF Group, with essential contributions from the U.S. Department of Energy, NASA, the National Science Foundation, and a few industrial partners. However, this narrow funding and leadership base is not sustainable. The responsibility for such critical infrastructure must not rest on the shoulders of a few.

## Why We Must Act—Together

To ensure HDF continues to serve the world's data needs for the next 20 years and beyond, we propose establishing a community-led HDF governance structure. This is not bureaucracy for bureaucracy's sake—it is a necessary step toward sustainability, collaboration, and shared stewardship. Here's why:
* **To broaden the funding base.** HDF is used by millions but funded by few. This imbalance must change. Through a shared governance structure, new contributors—academic, governmental, and industrial—can co-invest in HDF's future.
* **To coordinate and scale development.** The dedicated team at The HDF Group performs exceptional work, but it's essential to recognize that they can't be experts in every field. The increasing demand for their services surpasses what one organization can realistically offer. By embracing a collaborative approach, we can harness diverse talents, experts, and resources, enabling us to tackle everything from bug fixes to innovative features to language bindings.
* **To give users a voice.** Right now, there is no structured way for the community to set priorities or weigh in on the future of HDF. Governance will provide this voice—through a representative Advisory Council and coordinated outreach efforts.
* **To strengthen outreach and support.** As HDF adoption has grown, so has the need for documentation, tutorials, training, and technical support. A better-resourced, better-organized project can meet these needs head-on.

## A Call to the Community

We are not starting from scratch. We have a strong foundation. What we need now is to build a shared vision—together. We invite HDF users, developers, stakeholders, and funders to join in shaping a formal governance framework for the project.

If HDF matters to your work—if you rely on it to move science, engineering, products, services, or innovation forward—this is your opportunity to invest in its future. Together, we can create an HDF Project that is resilient, responsive, and ready for what comes next.

What can you do?

**Join the Conversation:** Reach out, participate, and share your unique insights and needs.

GitHub discussion => [HDF Alliance](https://github.com/HDFAlliance)

**Join an HDF Working Group meeting**

**Spread the Word:** Tell your peers, colleagues, and friends. Strength in numbers means strength for HDF.

**Commit to Collaboration:** Consider how your organization can co-invest—whether through funding, contributions, expertise, or outreach.

This is more than an invitation—it's a responsibility. Let's seize this opportunity to guide HDF towards a resilient and sustainable future.

Together, we can secure this commons, this ecosystem, and together, we can ensure that HDF remains a cornerstone for innovation, discovery, and growth.
